# Problem Statement #

Rental bikes are currently introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern.
